	<h1>The City of Seattle</h1>
	
	<div class="div1">
		<p>Seattle is located right off the East end of the Puget sound.  It is a very diverse city with lots of things to do.  These things include visiting the iconic space needle or Chihuly Garden of Glass.  Some less guided attractions are Pike Place Market or go to Kerry Park.  Other fun quick things are visiting the freemont bridge troll or go to the Japenese gardens.  </p></div>
