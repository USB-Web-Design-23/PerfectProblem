	<h1>Mount St. Helens</h1>
	
	<div class="div1">
		<p>Mt. St. Helens is a mountain in the cascade mountain range.  It is located in the southern part of Washington state.  It stands 8,364 ft (2549 m) above sea level and is a recently inactive Volcano.  The last major eruption was in 1980 and after that it still had activity until 2008.  Being that this is the case there are lots of interestering things to do around it.  There is a day hike to a lookout point that gives you excellent views of the crater.  From another lookout there is a visitor center and muesuem that gives great insight into the volcanic activity.  </p></div>
